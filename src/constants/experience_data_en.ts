    description: "As a Freelance Full Stack Developer, I worked on the design and development of the Pitchfy platform for a client in the U.S., using technologies such as React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. My involvement ranged from creating a modern and intuitive interface to implementing advanced features like an intelligent chatbot to enhance user interaction. Additionally, I integrated a Google login system using Google Cloud, a secure payment system with Stripe, and deployed the backend on an AWS EC2 server, ensuring scalability and high performance. I also managed the final deployment of the website using a GoDaddy domain and AWS Route 53. During the process, I optimized the platform's SEO, resulting in increased visibility on search engines, and improved the page's performance by 50%, significantly reducing load times and enhancing the user experience.",
